You are a senior TypeScript programmer with experience in the NestJS framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to NestJS

### Basic Principles

- Use modular architecture
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
  - One module per main domain/route.
  - One controller for its route.
    - And other controllers for secondary routes.
  - A models folder with data types.
    - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
    - Declare simple types for outputs.
  - A services module with business logic and persistence.
    - Entities with MikroORM for data persistence.
    - One service per entity.
- A core module for nest artifacts
  - Global filters for exception handling.
  - Global middlewares for request management.
  - Guards for permission management.
  - Interceptors for request management.
- A shared module for services shared between modules.
  - Utilities
  - Shared business logic

### API Documentation

- Use Swagger/OpenAPI to document all APIs.
  - Install and configure @nestjs/swagger at the beginning of the project.
  - Enable Swagger UI for development environments.
- Document each endpoint with Swagger decorators:
  - @ApiTags() to group endpoints by domain.
  - @ApiOperation() to describe the endpoint functionality.
  - @ApiParam() to document path parameters.
  - @ApiQuery() to document query parameters.
  - @ApiBody() to document request body.
  - @ApiResponse() to document possible responses.
- Document all DTOs with decorators:
  - @ApiProperty() to describe properties.
  - Include examples and descriptions.
- Keep documentation updated with each API change.

### Response Standardization

- Create a consistent response structure for all APIs:
  - Implement a global interceptor to standardize responses.
  - Use a standard format for all responses:
    typescript
    {
      success: boolean;
      data?: any;
      error?: {
        code: string;
        message: string;
        details?: any;
      };
      meta?: {
        pagination?: {
          page: number;
          limit: number;
          total: number;
        };
      }
    }
    
- Create reusable response classes:
  - SuccessResponse<T> for successful responses.
  - ErrorResponse for error responses.
  - PaginatedResponse<T> for paginated responses.
- Establish consistent HTTP status codes:
  - 200: for successful responses with data.
  - 201: for successful creation responses.
  - 204: for successful responses without content.
  - 400: for validation errors or bad requests.
  - 401: for authentication errors.
  - 403: for authorization errors.
  - 404: for resources not found.
  - 500: for internal server errors.
- Implement a consistent error handling strategy:
  - Create custom exception filters.
  - Define a domain exception hierarchy.
  - Map technical exceptions to domain exceptions.

### Pagination Guidelines

- Implement pagination for any service that returns collections of data:
  - Use query parameters for pagination control: page, limit, sort, order.
  - Set reasonable defaults: page=1, limit=10.
  - Return total count and metadata alongside results.
  - Include pagination metadata in the standard response:
    typescript
    {
      success: true,
      data: T[],
      meta: {
        pagination: {
          page: number,
          limit: number,
          total: number,
          totalPages: number
        }
      }
    }
    
- For large datasets, implement cursor-based pagination as an alternative:
  - Use after or before parameters with cursor IDs instead of page numbers.
  - Include nextCursor and prevCursor in response metadata.
- Document pagination parameters with Swagger:
  - @ApiQuery({ name: 'page', required: false })
  - @ApiQuery({ name: 'limit', required: false })
- Apply consistent sorting options:
  - Accept sort parameter for field name and order parameter for direction.
  - Document all sortable fields in API documentation.
- Implement appropriate database indexing for sorted fields.

### Documentation and Comments

- Add step-by-step comments for complex logic:
  ```typescript
  // 1. First step: Validate input data
  const isValid = validateInput(data);
  
  // 2. Second step: Process the data
  const processedData = processData(data);
  
  // 3. Third step: Save to database
  await saveToDatabase(processedData);
  ```

- Document the purpose of each major section:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * SECTION: User Authentication
   * This section handles all user authentication related operations
   * including login, registration, and token management.
   */
  ```

- Explain complex algorithms or business logic:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * ALGORITHM: Password Strength Checker
   * This function implements a multi-step password strength validation:
   * 1. Length check (minimum 8 characters)
   * 2. Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
   * 3. Common password check
   * 4. Sequential character check
   */
  ```

- Comment on edge cases and error handling:
  ```typescript
  // EDGE CASE: Handle empty array input
  if (items.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  // ERROR HANDLING: Validate API response
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new ApiError('Invalid response from external service');
  }
  ```

- Document configuration and setup steps:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * CONFIGURATION: Database Connection
   * Steps to establish database connection:
   * 1. Load environment variables
   * 2. Validate connection parameters
   * 3. Create connection pool
   * 4. Set up error handling
   */
  ```

- Explain complex type definitions:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * TYPE: UserPermissions
   * Represents the complete set of permissions a user can have:
   * - read: Basic read access
   * - write: Ability to modify data
   * - admin: Full system access
   * - custom: Custom defined permissions
   */
  ```

### Testing

- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Write tests for each controller and service.
- Write end to end tests for each api module.

- Add a admin/test method to each controller as a smoke test.
